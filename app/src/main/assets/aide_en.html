<div class="t2">Rising / falling moon</div>

<div class="t3"> The moon is in an ascending period when it is higher and higher in the sky from one
    day to the next
    and is in a waning period when it is not, but there is no
    simple way of determining at any given moment whether the moon is waxing or waning.
    A complete cycle lasts 27 days, 7 hours and 43 minutes.
    It is this aspect that is mainly used in biodynamic agriculture. The work to be done in the
    waning moon is as follows:
    <ul>
        <li> Transplant and plant,</li>
        <li> Work the soil, bury fertilizers and soil improvers,</li>
        <li> Prune to slow growth and make more vigorous,</li>
        <li> Mow in the waning moon to slow the growth of the lawn,</li>
        <li> Lighten,</li>
        <li> Harvest the root vegetables,</li>
        <li> Take the cuttings and cut,</li>
        <li> Dividing and layering,</li>
        <li> Collect grafts,</li>
        <li> Harvest the root vegetables and bulbs.</li>
    </ul>
    The work to be done in the rising moon:
    <ul>
        <li> Sow,</li>
        <li> Graft,</li>
        <li> Harvest vegetables, flowers, fruits and leaves.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="t2"> Waning / waxing moon</div>
<div class="t3"> The moon is waxing when the visible part of it increases in size from one day to
    the next.
    This corresponds to the period between the new moon and the full moon.
    The ancients called this the young moon. Conversely, the moon is waning (old moon)
    between the full moon and the new moon, each period lasting about 14.5 days. The influence
    of the waxing/waning moon is not taken into account in this application. There are
    tricks to determine whether the moon is waxing or waning.
    Simply remember that the boundary between the visible part
    (white) and the non-visible (black) of the moon always moves from one day to the next from
    right (West) to left (East).
</div>
<div class="t2">Zodiac constellations</div>
<div class="t3">In just over 27 days, the moon passes successively in front of the 12
    constellations of the zodiac. It first rises from the middle of Sagittarius, passing through
    Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, until the middle of Gemini. It then descends from
    the end of Gemini
    until Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio and then the beginning of Sagittarius.
    There is in fact a 13th constellation between Scorpio and Sagittarius, Serpentarius.
    Information may vary from one book to another. In Lunoid, we will consider this to be a period
    of
    a leaf-type period.
    It should also be noted that the boundary between two signs is not clear-cut and that a period
    of uncertainty of
    2 or 3 hours exists at the moment of transition. We will therefore have to wait
    until the Moon is clearly established in a given sign.
</div>
<div class="t2">Apogee</div>
<div class="t3"> The moon is at its apogee when it is at its furthest from the earth, at a distance
    of about 406 700 km. In some documents, apogee is not considered to be a harmful period
    and is assimilated to a flower day.
</div>
<div class="t2">Perigee</div>
<div class="t3"> The moon is at perigee when it is closest to the Earth, at a distance of
    around 356 500 km. Plants sown during this period will tend to germinate poorly
    and have growth problems.
</div>
<div class="t2">Node</div>
<div class="t3"> A node corresponds to the moment when the moon intersects the plane of rotation of
    the Earth around the Sun. The node is either descending when the Moon is in descending or
    ascending when the Moon is rising.
</div>
<div class="t2">Bad days</div>
<div class="t3"> The apogee, perigee, the ascending or descending lunar nodes correspond to periods
    harmful to cultures and where it is necessary to abstain from all work, at least in the period
    between 5 hours before and 5 hours after the event.
</div>
<div class="t2">Flower days</div>
<div class="t3"> Period to be favored for work on flowering vegetables: cauliflower, artichoke,
    broccoli. The flower days correspond to the passage of the moon in front of a constellation in
    affinity with the Air element, namely Gemini, Libra or Aquarius.
</div>

<div class="t2"> Fruit days</div>
<div class="t3"> Period to be favored for work on fruit vegetables and grains: tomato, cucumber,
    zucchini, beans. The fruit days correspond to the passage of the moon in front of a
    constellation in affinity with the Fire element, namely Aries, Leo or Sagittarius.
</div>
<div class="t2"> Root days</div>
<div class="t3"> Period to be favored for work on root vegetables: radishes, potatoes, carrots. The
    root days correspond to the passage of the moon in front of a constellation in affinity with the
    element Earth, namely Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn.
</div>
<div class="t2"> Leaf days</div>
<div class="t3"> Period to be favored for work on leafy vegetables: salad, sorrel, parsley. The leaf
    days correspond to the passage of the moon in front of a constellation in affinity with the
    Water element, namely Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces.
</div>
<div class="t2">The Ice Saints</div>
<div class="t3">The Ice Saints (Saint Mamert, Saint Pancrace and Saint Servais) correspond to the
    period
    from 11, 12 and 13 May until which there is still a risk of frost. This
    was clearly noticeable in 2020, so it is generally advisable to wait until the second half of
    the second half of May to transplant tomatoes and courgettes.
</div>
<div class="t2">Gibbous moon</div>
<div class="t3">The moon is gibbous when the visible part is larger than the non-visible part.
    In the case of a waxing moon, this corresponds to the period between the first
    quarter and the full moon, and in the case of a waning moon, to the period between the full moon
    and the last quarter.
</div>
<div class="t2">Red moon</div>
<div class="t3">The red moon is the first lunation (between two new moons) after Easter.
    For 2024, this is the period between 8 April and 8 May. This is a period when the risk of frost
    for unprotected young shoots on cloudless nights. For those
    wondering what a religious festival has to do with it, remember that the date of Easter is
    calculated (according to ecclesiastical comput) as being the first Sunday after the first full
    moon after the first day of spring.

</div>
<div class="t2">Blue moon</div>
<div class="t3">The second full moon in the same month is called a blue moon. There has
    been a blue moon on 31 October 2020 and the next will take place in January 2039.
</div>
<div class="t2">Biodynamic agriculture</div>
<div class="t3">Introduced in 1924 by Rudolph Steiner (1861-1925) and subsequently developed from
    1960 by Maria Thun (1922-2012), biodynamic agriculture is based on taking into account
    the influences of the Moon and the planets and the use of special preparations:
    <ul>
        <li> Preparation 500: Horn manure, for the soil and plant roots</li>
        <li> Preparation 501 : Horn silica, works on the aerial parts of plants during their growth
            phase.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
